\section*{\textsc{Research Focus}}
My interest is in how groups of the intra-team interactions of a multiagent system can be leveraged to enable teams to complete complex tasks.
I am interested in applying this toward heterogeneous robotic teams in remote locations, for autonomous completion of complex tasks.
