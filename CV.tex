\section*{Research Focus}
My interests are in artificial intelligence methods for collaboration and coordination in teams of autonomous agents. I am investigating multi-reward reinforcement learning structures to train teams to operate in tasks with fuzzy concepts of success. 
I am also interested in how teams of agents synthesize explanations for human observers.
